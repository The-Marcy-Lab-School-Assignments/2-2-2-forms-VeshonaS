# Question
Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

The first will do nothing(unless nested in a form tag then it will automatically submit), the second will submit the information entered by the user, the third will refresh the page, and the last one will do nothing.
