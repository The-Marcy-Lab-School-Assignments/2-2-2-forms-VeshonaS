# Question
Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer
The first will do nothing(unless nested in a form tag then it will automatically submit), the second will submit the information entered by the user, the third will refresh the page, and the last one is used to make create your own actions for the button once clicked on by the user.

# Teacher Feedback

One small correction, the reset button will not refresh the page but rather reset or refresh the form!
